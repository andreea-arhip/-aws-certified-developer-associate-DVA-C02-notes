### 📦 What is a VPC?
A Virtual Private Cloud is your own network within AWS.

Provides network isolation, custom IP ranges, subnets, routing, and security controls.

Each AWS Region has independent VPCs.

### 📐 VPC Basics
| Feature            | Notes                                                                |
| ------------------ |----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CIDR Block**     | Private IP range, e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`                                |
| **Subnets**        | Must be **non-overlapping**, and **subset of VPC CIDR**              |
| **Public Subnet**  | Connected to Internet Gateway (IGW) → resources can have public IPs. |
| **Private Subnet** | No IGW → no inbound internet. Outbound requires NAT Gateway          |
| **Reserved IPs**   | 5 IPs per subnet are reserved                                        |
| **Max Subnets**    | Soft limit = 200 (can increase)                                      |

👉 Think: Public = front door (web servers, ALB). Private = back room (databases, app servers).

### 🌍 Internet Access
| Component                  | Purpose                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Internet Gateway (IGW)** | Enables internet access to public subnets                                                         |
| **NAT Gateway**            | Sits in a public subnet, has Elastic IP, lets private subnets go out to internet (outbound only). |
| **Egress-Only IGW**        | Same as NAT but only for IPv6                                                                     |

❗Exam trick:
- Private subnet + internet = NAT Gateway
  - Private servers can talk to the internet, but the internet cannot talk back.
  - For inbound internet access, you’d need a public subnet + IGW.
- Public subnet + internet = IGW + public IP (Elastic IP if you want static).

### 🔄 Routing
- Subnets are tied to Route Tables

- Routes define how traffic moves (e.g., local, IGW, NAT GW, VPC Peering)

- Main route table is the default for all subnets unless specified.

### 🔒 Security in VPC
- Security Groups (SGs) → stateful (if inbound allowed, outbound automatically allowed).
- NACLs → stateless (must allow both inbound + outbound explicitly).
- Default SG → allows nothing inbound, everything outbound.

👉 Exam trick: If you see “stateful vs stateless” → SG = stateful.<br>
✅ Use Security Groups for application-layer control.

### 🛠️ VPC Endpoints
Used when resources in private subnet need AWS services without internet.
- Gateway Endpoint → for S3, DynamoDB.
- Interface Endpoint (ENI) → for most other services (SSM, API Gateway, etc).

👉 Exam trick: Lambda in private subnet → needs S3 = Gateway Endpoint, NOT NAT.

### 🔗 VPC Connections
- VPC Peering → connects 2 VPCs privately. Must add routes both sides. NOT transitive.
- Transit Gateway → hub for connecting many VPCs/on-prem. Transitive supported.

👉 Exam trick: If 3+ VPCs need to talk → Transit Gateway, not peering.

### 📎 Elastic IP (EIP)
- Static IPv4 address.
- Used for: NAT Gateway, bastion hosts, EC2 needing fixed IP.
- You only pay if it’s not attached.

👉 Exam trick: If they say “static public IP required” → Elastic IP.

### 🧠 Memory Tips
| Keyword                                  | Think Of                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| "No internet access from private subnet" | ❌ IGW, ✅ NAT Gateway or Endpoint        |
| "Lambda in VPC cannot access S3"         | Missing VPC **Gateway Endpoint**        |
| "High network traffic across VPCs"       | Prefer **Transit Gateway** over Peering |
| "Private network access to AWS service"  | Use **VPC Endpoint**                    |
| "Static IP"                              | Use **Elastic IP**                      |

### ❌ Common Exam Traps
- Assuming all subnets can access internet by default → ❌ Only public subnets with IGW can. 
- Forgetting to update route tables when adding NAT Gateway or VPC peering. 
- Trying to use NAT Gateway for IPv6 → ❌ Use Egress-Only Internet Gateway. 
- Confusing SGs (stateful) and NACLs (stateless).

| **EC2/Lambda in VPC needs private access to SSM, API Gateway, Secrets Manager**                  | Use **Interface Endpoint (ENI-based)**.                                                                                 |

| **Connect many VPCs + on-prem (scalable)**                                                       | Use **Transit Gateway (TGW)** (supports transitive routing).                                                            |
| **EC2 in subnet needs a static IP**                                                              | Assign **Elastic IP** (EIP).                                                                                            |
| **Bastion Host** (special EC2 instance in a public subnet - lets you SSH in private subnet EC2s) | Place EC2 in **public subnet** with Elastic IP + SSH access, then access private subnet EC2s through it.                |
| **High availability NAT**                                                                        | Use **NAT Gateways in multiple AZs**.                                                                                   |

| **Multiple AZ resilience for VPC Endpoints**                                                     | Deploy **endpoints in each AZ** used by private subnets.                                                                |
| **Application needs millions of cross-VPC connections**                                          | Use **Transit Gateway**, not VPC peering (scales better).                                                               |
