| **AWS Managed Microsoft AD** | Full Microsoft Active Directory hosted by AWS (enterprise-grade).                      | If you need **real AD** in the cloud. Works with EC2, RDS (SQL Server), WorkSpaces, and integrates with on-prem. | ‚ÄúWe want Windows EC2s and WorkSpaces in AWS to join a domain without running our own AD servers.‚Äù |
| **AD Connector**             | **Proxy/bridge** that forwards requests to your **on-prem AD**. No data stored in AWS. | If you already have **on-prem AD** and just want AWS resources to authenticate against it.                       | ‚ÄúWe want AWS WorkSpaces users to log in with their existing corporate AD accounts.‚Äù               |
| **Simple AD**                | Low-cost, **Samba-based** directory. Lightweight alternative to Microsoft AD.          | For **small teams**, test/dev, or when you don‚Äôt need full AD features.                                          | ‚ÄúWe want a cheap directory service to manage users/groups for dev environments.‚Äù                  |
