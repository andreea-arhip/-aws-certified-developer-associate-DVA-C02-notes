### üß† What is SQS?
Amazon SQS is a fully managed, serverless message queuing service that enables decoupling of distributed components.

Unlike SNS (which is push-based), SQS is a pull-based system.

### üß© SQS Queue Types
| Queue Type         | Use Case                                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Standard Queue** | Default, nearly-unlimited throughput, best-effort ordering, at-least-once delivery                                 |
| **FIFO Queue**     | First-In-First-Out, **exactly-once processing**, guaranteed order, limited throughput (300‚Äì3000 tps with batching) |


### üßÉ Message Lifecycle
| Step                   | Detail                                                          |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SendMessage**        | Producers send messages to the queue                            |
| **ReceiveMessage**     | Consumers poll for messages (long or short polling)             |
| **Visibility Timeout** | Hides message after being read ‚Äî prevents double processing     |
| **DeleteMessage**      | Must explicitly delete after processing to prevent reprocessing |


### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Configuration Options
| Option                      | Default / Limit                      | Notes                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Message retention**       | 4 days (min 1 min ‚Äì max 14 days)     | How long SQS stores unconsumed messages                            |
| **Visibility timeout**      | Default 30 sec, max 12 hours         | Hide msg after retrieval, avoid duplication                        |
| **Max message size**        | 256 KB                               | Use S3 for larger payloads (store link in msg)                     |
| **Delivery delay**          | Up to 15 minutes (Delay Queue)       | Delay message delivery                                             |
| **Dead-letter queue (DLQ)** | For failed messages (redrive policy) | Messages can be moved after X total receives without being deleted |

### üì¶ SQS + Lambda + DLQ Scenarios
| Scenario                                                                          | Partial Batch Response? | What Happens to Successful Messages?                                        | What Happens to Failed Messages?                                          | Which DLQ?                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **1.

All can hit DLQ if count ‚â• `maxReceiveCount` | **SQS DLQ**                      |
| **2. Batch fails (some messages fail)**                                           | ‚úÖ Yes                   | Successful messages deleted immediately                                     | Only failed messages remain in queue, `ReceiveCount++` only for them      | **SQS DLQ** (per failed message) |
| **3. Message hits `maxReceiveCount`**                                             | Any                     | ‚Äî                                                                           | Message moves to **SQS DLQ** automatically                                | **SQS DLQ**                      |
| **4. Lambda can‚Äôt be invoked at all** (bad permissions, throttling, service down) | Any                     | None are processed                                                          | Entire batch payload sent to **Lambda DLQ** after Lambda retry policy     | **Lambda DLQ**                   |
| **5. Lambda invoked but throws error for entire batch**                           | ‚ùå or ‚úÖ                  | ‚Äî                                                                           | All messages stay in queue, `ReceiveCount++` for all                      | **SQS DLQ** if count exceeded    |
| **6. Successful processing**                                                      | Any                     | All messages deleted from queue                                             | ‚Äî                                                                         | No DLQ used                      |

‚ö†Ô∏è Golden Rules to Remember for Exam:
- SQS DLQ = controlled by maxReceiveCount. Doesn‚Äôt care about Lambda internal success/fail, only about how many times the message was received without being deleted.
- Lambda DLQ = only for failed invocations. It‚Äôs about Lambda not even successfully processing (e.g., code error before processing, service down).
- Without Partial Batch Response: one bad apple spoils the whole batch ‚Äî every message in that batch gets ReceiveCount++ and can be sent to DLQ together.
- With Partial Batch Response: only failed messages remain; successful ones are deleted immediately.
- Visibility Timeout just controls when the message reappears for retry ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt change DLQ logic.
