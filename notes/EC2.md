## 🚀 Amazon EC2 – BASICS
### 🧠 What Is EC2?
- Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a virtual server in the cloud.
- You choose:
  - Instance type (vCPU + memory)
  - Storage (EBS or instance store)
  - OS (Linux, Windows)
  - Network (VPC, subnets, IPs)
  - Pricing model (on-demand, spot, reserved, etc.)

### 🛠️ Key Concepts
| Concept              | Description                                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AMI**              | Amazon Machine Image (pre-configured OS + software)                  |
| **Instance Type**    | Defines CPU, RAM, network bandwidth                                  |
| **User Data**        | Run a script on first boot (bash, PowerShell) – great for automation |
| **Security Group**   | Virtual firewall (stateful, allow rules only)                        |
| **Key Pair (SSH)**   | Required to connect via SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows)                 |
| **Elastic IP**       | Static public IP that you can remap                                  |
| **IAM Role for EC2** | Grant EC2 permissions to call AWS services                           |
| **Placement Group**  | Control placement strategy (clustered, spread, partition)            |

### 🧪 Exam Triggers
| Scenario                                      | You Choose                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Need to run a custom script at instance start | ✅ Use User Data               |
| Want EC2 to access S3 without keys            | ✅ Attach IAM Role             |
| Need to allow incoming HTTP traffic           | ✅ Security Group with port 80 |
| Want to SSH into a Linux EC2                  | ✅ Create Key Pair             |
| Need to scale web server                      | ✅ Use Auto Scaling Group      |

## 💾 EC2 INSTANCE STORAGE

## 🧱 EBS (Elastic Block Store)
- Persistent block storage for EC2 
- Survives instance stop/start (unless deleted)
- Snapshots for backup (stored in S3)
- Attached to one EC2 instance at a time 
- Supports encryption and resizing

🧠 Use EBS when you want data to persist after instance termination.

### 📦 EBS Volume Types – Quick Cheat Sheet
| Volume Type                        | Key Traits                                                      | Use Case                                 | Bootable? |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `gp3` (General Purpose SSD)        | Default. Baseline 3,000 IOPS. Cheaper & more flexible than gp2. | General workloads, boot volumes          | ✅ Yes     |
| `gp2` (Legacy General Purpose SSD) | Baseline IOPS based on size.                                    | Older instances, general workloads       | ✅ Yes     |
| `io1/io2` (Provisioned IOPS SSD)   | High-performance, provisioned IOPS. `io2` = more durable.       | High-performance DBs (e.g., RDS, Oracle) | ✅ Yes     |
| `st1` (Throughput-optimized HDD)   | Low cost, high throughput. Not for small random I/O.            | Big data, streaming, logs                | ❌ No      |
| `sc1` (Cold HDD)                   | Cheapest. Lowest performance.                                   | Infrequent access, cold backups          | ❌ No      |
| `standard` (Magnetic - deprecated) | Legacy. Avoid in new projects.                                  | Legacy systems only                      | ✅ Yes     |

💡 Tips for the Exam
- gp3 > gp2: If cost-efficiency + performance = needed → think gp3.
- io1/io2: Pick when "high IOPS" or "critical DB" appears in the question.
- st1/sc1: Only for large, sequential workloads (e.g., logs, cold data).
- Only gp2/gp3/io1/io2 can be used for boot volumes.
- io2 > io1 in durability — if "durability" is mentioned, go io2.

## ⚡ Instance Store (Ephemeral)
- Physically attached to host (like NVMe SSDs)
- Non-persistent – data lost if instance stops/terminates 
- High IOPS, very fast 
- Cannot be resized or snapshotted

🧠 Use instance store for temporary data like caches, buffers, scratch space.

### 📦 EBS vs Instance Store
| Feature     | EBS                       | Instance Store               |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Persistence | ✅ Survives stop/start     | ❌ Data lost on stop          |
| Speed       | Slower (network attached) | 🔥 Very fast (local to host) |
| Snapshots   | ✅ Supports snapshots      | ❌ No snapshot support        |
| Use case    | DB, app data              | Caches, temp files           |

## 🧰 High Availability & Scalability
### 🧬 High Availability (HA)
| Technique                    | Purpose                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multiple AZs**             | Deploy across different Availability Zones to survive outages |
| **Elastic Load Balancer**    | Distribute traffic across instances (multi-AZ)                |
| **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** | Replace unhealthy instances automatically                     |
| **CloudWatch + Alarms**      | Monitor instance metrics and trigger recovery                 |


### 📈 Scalability
| Type                   | Description                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Vertical scaling**   | Resize instance type (e.g. t3.small → m6i.large) |
| **Horizontal scaling** | Add more instances (ASG + ELB)                   |

🧠 Horizontal scaling = better fault tolerance.

🧠 Use launch templates/configs for consistent instance creation.

| **6. Dedicated Instances**      | Isolation at hardware level, but not full control                | - Run on hardware isolated to a single customer<br>- Still share the underlying hardware control with AWS                             |
| **7. Capacity Reservations**    | Guarantee capacity for AZ in advance                             | - Pay even if not used<br>- Combine with RIs for discount                                                                             |

### 🧪 Exam Traps & Scenario Tips

## 🔐 EC2 + IAM
Attach IAM Role to EC2 instance to grant permissions to AWS services (no access keys needed).
- Can be added/changed after launch.

🧪 Exam Example:
  - Your EC2 instance needs to read from DynamoDB and write to S3.
  
  - ✅ Answer: Attach IAM Role with necessary policies.
