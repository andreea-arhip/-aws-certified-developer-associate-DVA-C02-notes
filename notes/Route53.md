### üìò What is Route 53?
A highly available and scalable DNS web service by AWS.

| Function                | Description                                                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DNS Service**         | Translates domain names to IP addresses                               |
| **Domain Registration** | You can buy/manage domains directly                                   |
| **Health Checks**       | Monitor endpoints to route traffic accordingly                        |
| **Traffic Routing**     | Advanced routing policies (e.g. latency-based, failover, geolocation) |


### üî§ Core Concepts
| Term                         | Meaning                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **DNS (Domain Name System)** | Phonebook of the internet (e.g., `example.com` ‚Üí IP) |
| **Hosted Zone**              | Container for records for a domain                   |
| **Record Set (DNS Record)**  | Maps domain to resource (A, AAAA, CNAME, etc.)       |
| **TTL (Time to Live)**       | Cache duration for DNS records                       |


### üì¶ Record Types
| Record Type       | Description                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A Record**      | Maps domain to IPv4 address                                               |
| **AAAA Record**   | Maps domain to IPv6 address                                               |
| **CNAME**         | Alias to **another domain name** (no root domain support)                 |
| **Alias**         | AWS-specific; maps domain to **AWS resources** (like ALB, S3, CloudFront) |
| **MX**            | Mail exchange                                                             |
| **TXT**           | Arbitrary text (SPF/DKIM/verification)                                    |
| **NS**            | Delegates subdomains to another name server                               |
| **SRV, PTR, SOA** | Other DNS standards (rarely tested in DVA-C02)                            |

üîÅ Alias vs. CNAME
- Alias works at root domain (e.g., example.com ‚Üí ALB)
- CNAME cannot be used for the root domain

### üì° Routing Policies
| Policy                               | Description                                                | Use Case                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Simple**                           | 1 record per name                                          | Single IP/domain             |
| **Weighted**                         | Split traffic by %                                         | A/B testing, gradual rollout |
| **Latency-based**                    | Route to region with lowest latency                        | Global apps                  |
| **Failover**                         | Primary ‚Üí Secondary based on health                        | High availability            |
| **Geolocation**                      | Route based on user‚Äôs location                             | Legal/geographic routing     |
| **Geoproximity (Traffic Flow only)** | Bias traffic based on location                             | Custom geographic control    |
| **Multivalue Answer**                | Return several healthy IPs (like poor man‚Äôs load balancer) | Simple failover/load sharing |

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Health Checks
- Can monitor:
  - Public IPs, endpoints, ELBs, etc.
- Used with:
  - Failover 
  - Multivalue Answer
- Health checks support:
  - HTTP, HTTPS, TCP 
  - String matching in response body
- You can also monitor CloudWatch Alarms

‚úÖ Tip: Use Health Check with Failover Routing to shift traffic if the primary is down.

### üß† Developer-Focused Scenarios
#### üß™ Scenario: Route traffic based on user location
‚û°Ô∏è Use Geolocation Routing

#### üß™ Scenario: Direct users to lowest latency AWS region
‚û°Ô∏è Use Latency-based Routing

#### üß™ Scenario: Use root domain (example.com) with S3 static website
‚û°Ô∏è Use Alias record, not CNAME

#### üß™ Scenario: Canary or blue/green deployment
‚û°Ô∏è Use Weighted Routing (e.g., 10% new version, 90% stable)

#### üß™ Scenario: Route to healthy service only
‚û°Ô∏è Use Failover Routing with Health Checks

#### üß™ Scenario: You need a simple public DNS for an EC2 or ELB
‚û°Ô∏è Use Simple Routing Policy

### ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Service Integrations
| AWS Service                   | Integration                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **S3 Static Website**         | Route 53 ‚Üí Alias ‚Üí S3                         |
| **CloudFront**                | Use **Alias** to point domain to distribution |
| **ALB/NLB**                   | Route 53 Alias ‚Üí ALB/NLB                      |
| **API Gateway Custom Domain** | Route 53 ‚Üí Alias ‚Üí API Gateway                |
| **CloudWatch**                | Health checks can use CloudWatch Alarms       |
| **Global Accelerator**        | Also offers static IP, but not DNS-based      |

| ‚ÄúFastest response globally‚Äù | Latency-based                  |
| ‚ÄúRoot domain to S3 or ALB‚Äù  | Alias record                   |
| ‚ÄúSimple public domain name‚Äù | Simple Routing                 |


### ‚ùå Common Exam Traps
‚ùå CNAME cannot be used for root domain

‚ùå Health checks do not work for private resources (e.g., private EC2)

‚ùå Alias ‚â† CNAME, Alias is AWS-specific and free

‚ùå Latency-based ‚â† geolocation ‚Äî latency is performance, geo is location

‚ùå Forgetting to attach health checks to failover/multivalue records
