## Study Notes

Welcome! This repository holds my study material, practice exam reflections, and final review resources in preparation for the **AWS Certified Developer – Associate (DVA-C02)** exam.

### Repository Structure

#### 📂 learning_notes/
These notes are grouped by service category (for example, `compute`, `storage`, `security`). Each file includes:
- Core facts and key definitions.
- Scenario-based notes (“if you see *X*, think *Y*”).
- Integration points and exam traps.

#### 📂 practice_exam_notes/
These folders contain my reflections from multiple practice exam sets:
- Questions I missed or found tricky.
- Why the correct answer is correct.
- Patterns I noticed (repeated themes).
- “Lessons learned” aimed at spotting exam-style tricks.

#### 📂 final_review/
This is my **cram zone**: the last-day review material.  
Contains:
- High-yield topics to revisit.
- A checklist to make sure nothing gets forgotten.
- Keywords and service associations I want fresh in my mind before the exam.

### 🎯 How I Used This Repo

1. **During learning**: Add or refine notes inside `learning_notes/`.
2. **After each practice exam**: Document mistakes, gotchas in `practice_exam_notes/`.
3. **Final days before the exam**: Shift focus entirely to `final_review/` and cycle through keywords, and traps.
