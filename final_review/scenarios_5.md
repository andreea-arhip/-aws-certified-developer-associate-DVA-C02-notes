# AWS Certified Developer Associate — Monitoring, Security, X-Ray, CloudTrail & Secrets (Detailed Exam Scenarios)

## CloudWatch

* **Detailed Exam-Oriented Scenarios & Patterns:**

  1. Monitor Lambda metrics → errors, duration, invocations. *Pattern:* Function health monitoring.
  2. Alarms → CPU, memory, throttling → auto-scaling triggers. *Pattern:* Proactive alerts.
  3. Dashboards → visualize multiple services in one view. *Pattern:* Centralized monitoring.
  4. CloudWatch Logs → Lambda subscription → real-time processing. *Pattern:* Event-driven logging.
  5. Custom metrics → application-specific performance metrics. *Pattern:* Tailored observability.
  6. Billing alarms → detect unexpected costs. *Pattern:* Cost monitoring.
  7. Metric math → combine multiple metrics for insights. *Pattern:* Advanced monitoring.
  8. Contributor Insights → find top talkers or hot keys. *Pattern:* Identify resource usage hotspots.
  9. EventBridge integration → automate reactions to events. *Pattern:* Event-driven automation.
  10. Logging & alerts → automated dashboard update on anomalies. *Pattern:* Real-time monitoring.

## X-Ray

* **Detailed Exam-Oriented Scenarios & Patterns:**

  1. Trace Lambda + API Gateway latency. *Pattern:* Performance bottleneck identification.
  2. Multi-service tracing → SQS, DynamoDB, HTTP calls. *Pattern:* Distributed application visibility.
  3. Annotate segments → business metrics in traces. *Pattern:* Correlate technical and business metrics.
  4. Sampling rules → control cost and volume. *Pattern:* Efficient tracing.
  5. Identify Lambda cold starts. *Pattern:* Serverless optimization.
  6. Service map → visualize architecture & dependencies. *Pattern:* Architecture understanding.
  7. Error rate analysis → debug exceptions. *Pattern:* Reliability improvement.
  8. Integration with CloudWatch dashboards. *Pattern:* Unified monitoring.
  9. Detect upstream/downstream latency. *Pattern:* Latency root cause analysis.
  10. X-Ray SDK manual instrumentation. *Pattern:* Custom trace data.

## CloudTrail

* **Detailed Exam-Oriented Scenarios & Patterns:**

  1. Log all API calls → auditing. *Pattern:* Compliance.
  2. Multi-region trail → high availability. *Pattern:* DR & visibility.
  3. S3 delivery → CloudWatch/Athena → queries. *Pattern:* Event analytics.
  4. Detect IAM role misuse. *Pattern:* Security auditing.
  5. GuardDuty integration → anomaly detection. *Pattern:* Proactive security.
  6. Retention policy → meet compliance. *Pattern:* Data retention.
  7. Event selector filters → write-only events. *Pattern:* Cost-efficient monitoring.
  8. Lambda automation → respond to critical events. *Pattern:* Event-driven security.
  9. Multi-account monitoring → centralized auditing. *Pattern:* Enterprise visibility.
  10. Security audits → changes to KMS/Secrets. *Pattern:* Sensitive data protection.

## Secrets Manager & KMS

* **Detailed Exam-Oriented Scenarios & Patterns:**

  1. Automatic rotation → database credentials. *Pattern:* Credential hygiene.
  2. Lambda runtime retrieval → dynamic secrets. *Pattern:* Secure runtime access.
  3. Fine-grained IAM → restrict access per app. *Pattern:* Principle of least privilege.
  4. KMS encryption → secure at rest. *Pattern:* Data protection.
  5. Versioning → rollback to previous secret. *Pattern:* Safe secret management.
  6. Cross-account access → resource-based policies. *Pattern:* Multi-account secret sharing.
  7. CI/CD integration → auto deployment without exposing secrets. *Pattern:* Secure deployment.
  8. Parameter Store vs Secrets Manager → plaintext vs sensitive. *Pattern:* Correct storage choice.
  9. Detect expired secrets → proactive rotation. *Pattern:* Operational security.
  10. CloudTrail logs → audit secret access. *Pattern:* Compliance & monitoring.

* **Patterns & Best Practices:** Use CloudWatch + X-Ray for monitoring, enable CloudTrail multi-region, use Secrets Manager for sensitive credentials, automate secret rotation.

* **Traps:** Forgetting multi-region trails, exposing secrets in code, ignoring sampling rules, missing alerts.
